          <p>You decided to learn x framework, You open youtube or any search engine you prefer to search for any tutorials related to this “x” framework and suddenly after 30 min you scream “Eureka”, I think this framework is similar to my previous framework and you are right you don’t have to learn it from scratch. In this post I will show to you my experience to learn frontend frameworks and how those frameworks are closed to each other.</p>
          
          <p>Every time you decided to learn a front end framework, you must hear those terms over and over ( components, routing and managing state ).
          Let’s break it down.</p>
          
          <h3>⚙️ Components</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li>The heart core for any framework building components makes it reusable.</li>
            <li>Most modern frameworks using <b>JSX</b> or <b>HTML</b> template engine</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>🚦 Managing state</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li>All frameworks are built with a way for components to internally manage their state without any need for an external library or tool.</li>
            <li>Many Frameworks are built with a way for components to share same state for example (<b>Angular</b> has a <a href="">Service</a>, <b>React</b> now has <a href="">Context API</a>).</li>
            <li>Sometimes frameworks solutions are not enough especially when your state is huge so you can consider using a library like <a href="">redux.</a></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>After finishing learning basics let’s get our hands dirty and <strong>start building projects.</strong></p>

          <h2>🔨 Building projects</h2>
          
          <p>In order to understand aspects of something you need to know it well and this knowledge does not come from reading books or watching visual lessons only, <mark>the real test comes with a <span>real problem in real life</span></mark>, during this article I bring you some ideas for projects covering many aspects of any frontend framework you choose.</p>
          
          <h3>📄 Notes:</h3>
          
          <p>The projects listed in this subject are gradual in their difficulty and each project adds to its predecessor. The order of projects from the youngest to the most comprehensive.</p>

          <p>The first application which is commonly used is the clone of any known site using its public <b>API</b>, try to build a simple search bar with drop-down list holds results coming from endpoint <b>API</b>, check returning data before displaying it like if there is an image or not to display.</p>

          <h2>🔒 2. Auth App</h2>
          
          <p>Some of this endpoint API I mention in the previous section require some authentication so in this section try to add or build another app with login/register page and if the user is login redirect him or her to the user homepage and prevent guest users from pages that require the user to be logged in.</p>

          <p>create, read, update and delete app is the most popular front-end app in this section you can build this app offline using local storage or using online service like Firebase or even integrated it with a back-end framework.</p>
